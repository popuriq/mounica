<td><p><b>By public transportation</b><hr size="2" color="black"><p>

<p>Buffalo's public transportation system is operated by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) [13]. They run both a single-line subway from the University at Buffalo's Main St. Campus on the north end to Erie Canal Harbor on the south end of downtown Buffalo, as well as an extensive bus network. As the subway enters the downtown core, the theater district, it emerges from the tunnel and runs above-ground. It is free to ride from this point south. To ride in the underground portion of the system, it costs $3.50 for a round-trip ticket, or $1.75 for a one-way ticket. It is a popular mode of transportation for employees and residents who live along the line and north of the city to commute downtown.

The bus and overall regional transportation system of the region is focused around three nodes: Downtown Buffalo, University Station on the University at Buffalo's South Campus, and Niagara Falls. Downtown Buffalo is the largest of the three nodes and the University station second. An important note about the system is that any user can transfer for free between bus routes and the rail line as long as the route intersects the rail line. This makes the rail line a strong backbone of the overall system, considering most of the bus routes originate from either the Downtown Transportation Center (Near Church station) or at University Station at the opposite end of the line. Bus-to-bus transfers cost 30 cents.

The NFTA also has a zone system in place; this means that anyone traveling outside from Zone 1, roughly the City of Buffalo proper, will have to pay a zone charge (also 30 cents) when exiting the bus. When traveling from outside of the city back Buffalo you pay the zone charge when boarding the bus. This difference often causes confusion among new users. There are a total of four zones within the system but most amenities or destinations around the region are accessible within the city and Zone 2, roughly the first ring suburbs.</p> 
<p><b>To Niagara Falls</b></p><hr size="2" color="black">

For those who want to visit Niagara Falls from Buffalo there is a direct Bus route between the two cities. Route 40 - Grand Island [14] serves this link between the two cities. You can catch the 40 from the Downtown Buffalo Transportation Center at the intersection of Elm and North Division Streets. This is just two blocks east of the Church Street Rail Station. The Bus will drive straight to Downtown Niagara Falls and then continue on to the Niagara Falls Transportation Center. The cost of this 26-mile trip is $4.50 round trip, or $2.25 each way.

To see other routes visit the NFTA's main webpage where schedules, maps and other information can be found. also note there is a whole system map available: [15].
<p><b>By car</b></p><hr size="2" color="black">

Buffalo has several expressways leading in and out of the city, the main being the Kensington Expressway (33) which begins at the airport on Genesee Street and concludes at Downtown Buffalo via Oak and Goodell Streets (depending on the direction of travel). Taxi service is available in urban areas, although it is limited. Do not expect to be able to hail a cab except outside the airport and in the bar districts. However, good dispatch is available. </td>
