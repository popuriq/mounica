<hr size="3" color="black"><font size="6">N</font>iagara Falls are voluminous waterfalls on the Niagara River, straddling the international border between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of New York. The falls are 17 miles (27 km) north-northwest of Buffalo, New York and 75 miles (120 km) south-southeast of Toronto, Ontario, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York.
Niagara Falls is composed of two major sections separated by Goat Island: Horseshoe Falls, the majority of which--two-thirds according to the US Geological Survey--lies on the Canadian side of the border, and American Falls on the American side.[1] The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also located on the American side, separated from the main falls by Luna Island.
Niagara Falls were formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age), and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean. While not exceptionally high, the Niagara Falls are very wide. More than 6 million cubic feet (168,000 m³) of water falls over the crest line every minute in high flow,[2] and almost 4 million cubic feet (110,000 m³) on average. It is the most powerful waterfall in North America.[3]
The Niagara Falls are renowned both for their beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power. Managing the balance between recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 1800s.<br><br>

<tr><td><p>Niagara is a town in Niagara County, New York, United States. As of the 2000 census, the town had a total population of 8,978. The town is named after the famous waterfall Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>The Town of Niagara is the neighbor to the City of Niagara Falls, which actually adjoins the famed Niagara Falls cataract. The town is located in the southwest corner of the county and is famed for its factory outlet mall (formerly Prime Outlet Niagara Falls), frequently visited by nearby Canadians based on the favorable currency exchange. Also located within the town is Niagara Falls International Airport, which serves the Niagara County area.
There is no separate post office, so the mailing address is Niagara Falls, NY. Both Niagara, NY, and Town of Niagara, NY, are not acceptable according to the US Postal Service when writing an address.<br><br></td></tr>
